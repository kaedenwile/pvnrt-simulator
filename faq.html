                <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

                <h2>What is thermodynamics?</h2>
                <p>Thermodynamics is the study of thermal energy and its interactions. The field encompasses the energy of gases, how energy is transferred between mediums, and even the fundamental laws that govern how energy behaves in the universe. Additionally, thermodynamics describes how energy, work, and heat function in a closed system.</p>

                <h2>Why is thermodynamics important?</h2>
                <p>The principles of thermodynamics applies to all thermal interactions in the known universe. On earth, this means thermodynamics is responsible for heat engines (such as the combustion engine in your car) as well as cooling systems (such as your refrigerator). Without a thorough understanding of the principles of thermodynamics, the many systems that run our world would not exist.</p>

                <h2>What are ideal gases?</h2>
                <p>Not all gases are equal--each is made of specific molecules that interact with each other in certain ways. However, at sufficiently high temperatures and low pressures, the behavior of almost every gas can be explained by thinking of the gas as an ideal gas. In an ideal gas, particles are only points and all collisions are perfectly elastic, so, mathematically, the behavior is easy to calculate.</p>

                <h2>What does the equation PV=nRT mean?</h2>
                <p>The equation PV=nRT is known as the ideal gas law, and relates the pressure, volume, temperature, and number of moles in a gas. Fairly obviously, P stands for pressure, V for volume, and T for temperature. Perhaps less obviously, n stands for the number of moles of the gas and R is the ideal gas constant. The specific value of R depends on the units used for other variables, although generally 8.131 Pa L mol-1 K-1 or 0.08203 atm L mol-1 K-1.</p>

                <h2>How does PV=nRT relate to other gas laws?</h2>
                <p>The ideal gas law is actually derived from three fundamental laws that are easily observable. The first The first, Boyle’s Law, simply states that pressure is inversely proportional to volume, Charles’s Law relates temperature proportionally to volume given a fixed pressure and constant amount of gas, and Avogadro’s Law states that volume is proportional to the amount of gas given a constant pressure. Each of the three laws can be observed in the ideal gas law if all other variables are held constant.</p>

                <h2>What does the Pressure vs. Volume graph say?</h2>
                <p>The pressure vs volume graph (PV chart) is a visualization of the state of the gas. As the state of the gas changes, the values will be traced on the chart, allowing the user to see the various thermodynamic processes that occur as a result of changing variables independently. Moreover, as processes occur, the PV chart can be used to determine the amount of work completed by integrating the resulting curve.</p>

                <h2>What is the internal energy of a gas related to?</h2>
                <p>The internal energy of a gas is the total kinetic energy of all the particles in the sample of gas. The internal energy therefore can be changed by changing the average kinetic energy of each particle through different processes, mostly adding thermal energy to the sample. In fact, the internal energy of a sample of gas is equal to the amount of thermal energy added to, or taken away from the sample in addition to the amount of work the sample has done (where in order for work to be done, volume must change).</p>

                <h2>How does a gas do work?</h2>
                <p>A gas does work by changing volume. For instance, a typical combustion engine does work by combusting a gas, causing an expansion, which turns the drive shaft. The work is done by the gas on the piston as the high pressures drive it. On the contrary, work can be done on a gas. For example, in a bicycle pump where the air is compressed by a reducing the volume repeatedly (the pressure is of course held by a one way valve). As work is done on the gas, the internal energy increases, and the increase in pressure also leads to an increase in temperature as described by the ideal gas law. In short, work goes two ways, gas can do work on the environment, and the environment can do work on a gas.</p>

                <h2>Do all gases behave like ideal gases?</h2>
                <p>The short answer is no. The longer answer is also no: in reality, the particles that make up a gas actually have volume and actually interact with one another. Instead of bouncing off of each other, they can interact with one another proportional to the strength of intermolecular forces. Polar molecules have greater intermolecular forces, and larger molecules move slower than a small molecule for the same temperature, giving more time to interact. In the end, intermolecular interactions make real gases not behave like an ideal gas.</p>
